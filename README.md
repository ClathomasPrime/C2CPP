# C2CPP
A Transcompiler for the Modern World

It has long been said that C is dieing. The modern world has simply moved beyond pointers and grown tired of “(int*)malloc(x*sizeof(int))”. But with so much code written in C, how are we to move on? This project solves a large portion of this problem, automatically translating many valid C programs into a more modern and usable language, C++. We believe this project shows the true power of source-to-source compilation, as it builds on the mission CoffeeScript and other projects to promote both readability and convenience.
